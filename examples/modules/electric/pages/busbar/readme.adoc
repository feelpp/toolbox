:page-description: We simulate the electrical potential in a busbar conductor.

In this example, we will model a busbar simply modeled as rectangular parallelepiped.A differential electrical potential is applied to the entry/exit of the busbar. We note respectively stem:[V_0] the electrical potential on the entry and  and stem:[V_1] on the exit.

== Running the case

The command line to run this case in 2D is

[[command-line-2d]]
[source,mpirun]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_electric --case "github:{path:toolboxes/electric/cases/busbar}" --case.config-file 2d.cfg
----

The command line to run this case in 3D is

[[command-line-3d]]
[source,mpirun]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_electric --case "github:{path:toolboxes/electric/cases/busbar}" --case.config-file 3d.cfg

== Geometry

The busbar conductor consists in a rectangular cross section extruded along the x axis in 2D.
In 3D, this is the same geometry, but extruded along the z axis.

=== Model & Toolbox

- This problem is fully described by the Electric model, namely a poisson equation for the electrical potential stem:[V] with Dirichlet boundary conditions on entry /exit.
- **toolbox**:  electric

=== Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions for the electrical probleme are introduced as simple Dirichlet boundary conditions for the electric potential on the entry/exit of the conductor. For the remaining faces, as no current is flowing througth these faces, we add Homogeneous Neumann conditions.

== Outputs

The main fields of concern are the electric potential stem:[V], the current density stem:[\mathbf{j}] and the electric field stem:[\mathbf{E}]. // presented in the following figure.

== Verification Benchmark

The analytical solution is given by:

[stem]
++++
V(x) = V_0 + (\frac{x}{L}-1) (V_1-V_0)
++++

Note that we may get an expression for the resistance stem:[R] of the busbar from this equation.
We recall that stem:[R] is defined as stem:[R = V_D/I] where stem:[I] stands for the total current
flowing in the busbar (stem:[V_D] corresponds to the differential applied voltage).

By definition:

[stem]
++++
I = \int_{V0} \mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{n} \,d\Gamma
++++

From Gauss law we have: stem:[\mathbf{j} = \sigma\,\mathbf{E} = -\sigma \nabla V]. It follows:

[stem]
++++
R = \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{Lx}{S}
++++
with stem:[S=Ly*Lz].

We will check if the approximations converge at the appropriate rate:

- k+1 for the stem:[L_2] norm for stem:[V]
- k for the stem:[H_1] norm for stem:[V]
- k for the stem:[L_2] norm for stem:[\mathbf{E}] and stem:[\mathbf{j}]
- k-1 for the stem:[H_1] norm for stem:[\mathbf{E}] and stem:[\mathbf{j}]
