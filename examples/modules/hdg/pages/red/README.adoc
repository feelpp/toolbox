This example shows the distribution of the electric potential stem:[V] in a nanoscale floating-gate nMOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistor working in inversion conditions.
The prefix "n" indicates that the electric current is due to negatively charged electrons.
This simulation involves a non-homogeneous problem with internal interfaces and it has been solved with the HDG method applied to the Darcy problem.
A more detailed description of this test case is illustrated in <<HDG2018>>.

== Geometry

A scheme of a realistic floating-gate nMOS transistor used as a nonvolatile memory device is shown with the schematic representation of the
two-dimensional cross-section in which the control gate is now included for sake of simplicity in the following Figure:

image:red/nMOS.png[]

The device is composed of a pair of n-doped source and drain regions, a p-doped substrate region and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) region in which a control gate and a floating gate are buried.
The floating gate is isolated from the control gate by an inter-polysilicon dielectric (IPD) layer beneath the control gate.

The geometry has been generated with GMSH:

== Model & Toolbox

* The main goal of the simulations is to determine, via the integral boundary condition, the value attained on stem:[\Gamma_G] at inversion conditions by the electric potential.
This value is the threshold voltage of the device, denoted henceforth by stem:[V_T] , and is a fundamental design parameter in integrated circuit nanoelectronics.
The accurate prediction of the threshold voltage may be significantly influenced by the numerical treatment of the heterogeneous material device structure across the interface stem:[\Gamma_{int}].
With this respect the HDG framework appears to be the ideal computational approach because it allows to enforce, at the same time and in a strong manner, (a) the jump of the normal component of
the electric displacement vector across the interface and (b) the continuity of the electric potential, at suitable quadrature nodes on each face belonging to stem:[\Gamma_{int}], unlike standard
displacement-based finite element discretization schemes which satisfy property (b) but fail at satisfying property (a).

=== Boundary conditions

Boundary conditions::
[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
V = \bar{V}_j + \bar{V}|_{bi,j} & \mbox{ on } \Gamma_j, j=S,D,B \\
\underline{D} \cdot \underline{n} = 0 & \mbox{ on } \Gamma^{lat}_si \cup \Gamma^{lat}_ox\\
\int_{\Gamma_G} \underline{D} \cdot \underline{n} d\Sigma = q \bar{N}_B \delta L_{ch} L_z & \mbox{ on } \Gamma_G
\end{align}
++++

Interface conditions::
[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
[V]_{\Gamma_{int}} &= 0\\
[\underline{D}]_{\Gamma_{int}} &= q \bar{N}_B \delta
\end{align}
++++

The quantities stem:[\bar{V}|_{bi,j}] are the built-in potentials associated with the subdomain regions stem:[ \Omega_j ,\: j = S,D,B ], while stem:[ \bar{N}_B ] is the concentration of ionized dopants
in the bulk region and stem:[\delta] is the width of the accumulation region in the stem:[y] direction of the channel.

=== Measures

The predicted value of stem:[V_T] is positive and given by stem:[V^{computed}_T = 0.854926] V.

The sign of stem:[V^{computed}_T] is in physical agreement with the fact that the transistor is of n type,
so that electron charges (negative) are attracted from the bulk region up towards the gate contact.

To quantitatively assess the accuracy of the estimate of the threshold voltage we adopt the analytical theory
for an ideal MOS system developed in <<Muller1986>>[Chapter 8] and use formula (8.3.18) of <<Muller1986>> to obtain
stem:[V^{ideal}_T = 0.8591] V, which agrees with the value predicted by the numerical simulation.
