The aim of this example is to model the
aerothermal flows in an airplane cabin. Cooling air is flowing in from
the inlet on the top and flowing out in the two outlets at the bottom
of the cabin. The six passengers are heating the domain with a
constant heat flux. 

This test case was proposed by Airbus Group. The interest of such 
simulation is to optimize the performances of the Environmental
Constrol System (ECS). The ECS manage, among other things, the
quality of the air. This equipment is crucial to guaranty the comfort
and the security of the passengers. Performing accurate and efficient
simulations on the present test case allows to optimize the ECS
capabilities with two levers of actions. First, the numerical models
can be used during the early phases of design and risk analysis, in
order to optimize the cabin. Then, the 3D simulation can be used in an
active way, coupled with the ECS, to predict the behaviour of the
aerothermal fields in the airplane. 

The physical hypothesis of the model are :

* Incompressible fluid
* Newtonian fluid
* Boussinesq approximation to describe the buoyancy force

These assumptions lead to a coupled system between the Navier-Stokes
equation for the fluid and an advection diffusion equation for the
temperature. We refer the reader to the documentation of the HeatFluid
toolbox for more details on this system of equations.

The following boundary conditions are applied:

* For the fluid (velocity/pressure)

** Dirichlet condition on the inlet with a Poiseuille profile of
magnitude stem:[U_{in}]:
+
[stem]
++++
u=(0,-U_{in}600(0.05-x)(x+0.05))
++++

** Free Stream condition on the outlets:
+
[stem]
++++
\mu\nabla u\cdot n-p n=0
++++

** Homogeneous Dirichlet (no-slip) condition on all the others solid
  walls:
+
[stem]
++++
u=(0,0)
++++

* For the temperature:

** A Dirichlet condition on the inlet:
+
[stem]
++++
T=T_{in}
++++

** A Neumann condition (constant flux):
+
[stem]
++++
-k\nabla T\cdot n=C_p Q_{P},

** A homogeneous Neumann condition (insulated walls) on the other
   solid walls:

\nabla T\cdot n=0

This example can be run on a 2D or a 3D geometry. We detail the input
data for both configuration in the following paragraphs.

== Boundary Conditions
We impose a standard no-slip condition on all the solid walls and on the passengers (homogeneous Dirichlet). The flow at the inlet it modeled by a poiseuille profile (Dirichlet). At the outlet we impose a do nothing (Neumann) condition.

The passengers heat sources are modeled by a constant heat flux (Neumann). 
The temperature at the inlet is imposed with a Dirichlet condition. 
An homogeneous Neumann condition is set on the outlets. 
Finally, all the other boundaries are supposed to be insulated.
