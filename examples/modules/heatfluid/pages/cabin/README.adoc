In this example we simulate the aerothermal flow in an airplane cabin. 
The six passengers are heating the domain with a constant heat flux. 
Cooling air is flowing in from the inlet on the top and flowing out in the two outlets at the bottom of the cabin. 
This example can be run on a 2D or a 3D geometry.

== Data files
The case data files are available in Github link:{uri-data}/cabin/[here]

For the 2D model :

* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin2d.cfg[CFG file]
* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin2d.json[JSON file]
* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin2d.geo[GEO file]

For the 3D model :

* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin3d.cfg[CFG file]
* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin3d.json[JSON file]
* link:{uri-data}/cabin/cabin3d.geo[GEO file]


== Geometry
The geometry is an simplified cut of the cabin. The passengers are modeled by the six egg-shaped objects

== Model & Toolbox
The model is  described in the HeatFluid toolbox docuentation. 
We consider, in this simulation, the buoyancy force, using the Boussinesq approximation. 
We can then observe natural convection as a consequence of this internal force. 

== Materials
We consider a fluid in all the domain. We use a smooth approximation of the real physical parameters of the air in order to  model the turbulent loss of energy in the small scales.

== Boundary Conditions
We impose a standard no-slip condition on all the solid walls and on the passengers (homogeneous Dirichlet). The flow at the inlet it modeled by a poiseuille profile (Dirichlet). At the outlet we impose a do nothing (Neumann) condition.

The passengers heat sources are modeled by a constant heat flux (Neumann). 
The temperature at the inlet is imposed with a Dirichlet condition. 
An homogeneous Neumann condition is set on the outlets. 
Finally, all the other boundaries are supposed to be insulated.

== Outputs
We are intersting in the visualisation of the three fields : the velocity, the pressure and the temperature of the fluid.
