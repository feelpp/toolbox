In this example, we will estimate the rise in temperature due to Joules losses in a stranded conductor. An electrical potential stem:[V_D] is applied to the entry/exit of the conductor which is also cooled by a force flow.

== Geometry

The conductor consists in a solenoid, which is one helix of a magnet.

=== Model & Toolbox

- This problem is fully described by a Thermo-Electric model, namely a poisson equation for the electrical potential stem:[V] and a standard heat equation for the temperature field stem:[T] with Joules losses as a source term.
Due to the dependence of the thermic and electric conductivities to the temperature, the problem is non linear. We can describe the conductivities with the following laws:
[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
\sigma(T) &= \frac{\sigma_0}{1+\alpha(T-T_0)}\\
k(T) &= \sigma(T)*L*T
\end{align*}

=== Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions for the electrical probleme are introduced as simple Dirichlet boundary conditions for the electric potential on the entry/exit of the conductor. For the remaining faces, as no current is flowing througth these faces, we add Homogeneous Neumann conditions.

| Marker | Type | Value |
| V0 | Dirichlet | 0 |
| V1 | Dirichlet | stem:[V_D] |
| Rint, Rext, Interface, GR_1_Interface | Neumann | 0 |

As for the heat equation, the forced water cooling is modeled by robin boundary condition with $Tw$ the temperature of the coolant and $h$ an heat exchange coefficient.

== Outputs

The main fields of concern are the electric potential stem:[V], the temperature stem:[T] and the current density stem:[\mathbf{j}] or the electric field stem:[\mathbf{E}] presented in the following figure.
