|image:sheet-rounding/image1.png[Effect of sheet rounding,100%] | The 10 mm thick steel gusset plate shown has four identical embossed bolt holes. The inside perimeters of the two lower holes are completely fixed aaginst displacement. The bolt load acting downward on the upper holes bears on the lower hal fon the inside edge of the hole. Determine the deformation and stress of the gusset plate. Check the effect of the rounding.

| image:t-beam/image2.png[T-Beam,100%] | Tee Section, also known as T beam or T bar, is a structural beam with a “T” shaped cross section. Tee section is generally made of plain carbon steel. Manufacturing methods of “T” sections are hot rolling, extrusion and plate welding. T bars are often used for general fabrication.
