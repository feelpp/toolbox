This benchmark is extract from the link:http://things.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/software/abaqus_docs/docs/v6.12/pdf_books/BENCHMARKS.pdf[Abaqus Benchmarks Manual].

== Definition

We focus on the link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le10.html[LE10] benchmarks in particular.

== Running the case

The command line to run this case is

[[command-line]]
[source,sh]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_solid --case "github:{path:toolboxes/solid/NAFEMS-LE10}"

<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="github:{path:toolboxes/solid/NAFEMS-LE10}">

== Data files

The case data files are available in Github link:{uri-data}/NAFEMS-LE10/[here]

* link:{uri-data}/NAFEMS-LE10/le10.cfg[CFG file] - [link:{uri-data-edit}/NAFEMS-LE10/le10.cfg[Edit the file]]

=== Geometry

The geometry is given link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le10.html[here] by : +

where the thickness is stem:[0.6].

In addition, we define the point E which is the midpoint of CC' and E' the midpoint of BB'.

=== Boundary conditions

We set:

- stem:[u_y = 0] on DCD'C'
- stem:[u_x = 0] on ABA'B'
- stem:[u_x = u_y = 0] on BCB'C'
- stem:[\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}\cdot\mathbf{n}=-1e^6] on the top surface.

== Inputs

We have the following parameters:

.Inputs
|===
| Name | Value

|stem:[E] | stem:[210\, GPa]
|stem:[\nu] | stem:[0.3]
|stem:[\rho] | stem:[7800\, kg/m^2]
|===

== Outputs

We want to compare the value of stem:[\sigma_{yy}] at the point D. The reference value is stem:[5.38\, MPa].

== Results

The value of stem:[\sigma_{yy}] at the point D is stem:[5.53\, MPa] for stem:[300 000] dofs, which is stem:[2.78%] higher than the target.

One possibility to get a more accurate output is to use a mixed formulation, where the stress tensor would also be an unknown.
