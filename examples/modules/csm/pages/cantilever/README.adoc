== Introduction
In order to evaluate the PERFORMANCE of the solid-structure interaction solver of FEEL ++, we realize here a benchmark on the deformation of an elastic structure, initially the Cantilever problem, we will simulate a simple cantilevered beam with a fixed end and a load applied to the other end.
We will compare the obtained results with different meshes and a different polynomial degree in order to evaluate the time resolution.  

== Running the model 

The configuration file are in `benchmarks/modules/csm/examples/cantilever`.

=== Notations and units

|===
| Notation | Quantity | Unit
|stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s]|displacement|stem:[m]
|stem:[\rho_s]|density|stem:[kg.m^{-3}]
|stem:[\lambda_s]|first Lamé coefficients|stem:[N.m^{-2}]
|stem:[\mu_s]|second Lamé coefficients|stem:[N.m^{-2}]
|stem:[E_s]|Young modulus|stem:[kg.m^{-1}.s^{-2}]
|stem:[\nu_s]|Poisson's ratio|dimensionless
|stem:[\boldsymbol{F}_s]|deformation gradient|
|stem:[\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s]| second Piola-Kirchhoff tensor|
|stem:[f_s^t]|body force|
|===

=== Equations and Linear elasticity

In this case we will use the following equations : 

* strain tensor stem:[\boldsymbol{F}_s = \boldsymbol{I} + \nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s]
* Cauchy-Green tensor stem:[\boldsymbol{C}_s = \boldsymbol{F}_s^{T} \boldsymbol{F}_s]
* Green-Lagrange tensor
[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{E}_s &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \boldsymbol{C}_s - \boldsymbol{I} \right)  \\
   &= \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \left( \nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s + \left(\nabla
   \boldsymbol{\eta}_s\right)^{T} \right)}_{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_s}
  + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \left(\left(\nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s\right)^{T}
  \nabla \boldsymbol{\eta}_s \right)}_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}_s}
\end{align}
++++

The second Newton's law allows us to define the fundamental equation of the solid mechanic, in this problem, we try to determine the displacement stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s], which verifies the following equation:
[stem]
++++
  \rho^*_{s} \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{\eta}_s}{\partial t^2}
  - \nabla \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{F}_s \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s\right)
  =    \boldsymbol{f}^t_s
++++


[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{F}_s &= \text{Identity} \\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s &=\lambda_s tr( \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_s)\boldsymbol{I} +
2\mu_s\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_s
\end{align}
++++

The Lamé coefficients are deducing from the Young's modulus stem:[E_s] and the Poisson's ratio stem:[\nu_s] of the material we work on and can be express 

[stem]
++++
\lambda_s = \frac{E_s\nu_s}{(1+\nu_s)(1-2\nu_s)}
\hspace{0.5 cm} 
,
\hspace{0.5 cm} 
\mu_s = \frac{E_s}{2(1+\nu_s)}
++++



== Geometry

We consider a solid structure, composed of an elastic bar, which is fixed on one side that we note stem:[\Gamma_{L}] (F:fixed) resulting in the displacement stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s=0] on the edges of stem:[\Omega_s] and a load applied to the other end that we note stem:[\Gamma_{L}=\partial\Omega_s \backslash \Gamma_F].

The geometry can be represented as follows:

[[img-geometry1]]
image::cantilever/CantileverCSMGeometry.png[caption="Figure 1 : ", title=" Geometry of the Cantilever CSM benchmark.", alt="CSM Geometry", width="500", align="center"]


In this case test, we will observe the behavior of stem:[A], during this simulation, we will obtain the displacement of stem:[A], on the axis stem:[x] and stem:[y] , when the elastic structure is subjected to its own weight and a hanging weight to her. 


== Input parameters 

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* On stem:[\Gamma_{F}],a condition that imposes this boundary to be fixed : stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s=0] 
  (ps: stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s] is the displacement )

* On stem:[\Gamma_{L}], a force will be applied on the other end of the beam.  
 
  
=== Discretization

To solve this problem we will use the Feel++ Toolboxes that use Finite Elements Method, with Lagrangian elements of order stem:[N] to discretize space.

There are several different Toolboxes available, such as: CSM, CFD, Heat Transfer, etc.
Of these, we need the CSM (Computational Solid Mechanics) Toolbox.

It is also necessary to define the type of the simulation. For example “Elasticity” is
generally applied in case of metals, and “Hyper-Elasticity” for plastics.



=== Solvers

Here are the different solvers (linear) used during results acquisition.

* Regarding the resolution, we used the conjugate gradient method with the mutligrille preconditioner, because we are working on a linear system.

=== Parameters 

The following table displays the material properties of the model.We will use the following data:

.Fixed and Variable Input Parameters
|===
| Name |Description | Nominal Value | Units
|stem:[g]| gravitational constant | 2 | stem:[m / s^2]
|stem:[l] | elastic structure length | stem:[40]  |stem:[m]

|stem:[E_s] | Young's modulus | stem:[206.84277e9]  | stem:[kg / ms^2]
|stem:[\nu_s] | Poisson's ratio | stem:[0.3]  |dimensionless
|stem:[\rho_s] | density | stem:[7870]  |stem:[kg/ m^3]
|===


== Outputs 

As described before, in this problem, we try to determine the displacement stem:[\boldsymbol{\eta}_s] on stem:[\Omega_s], which verifies the following equation:
[stem]
++++
\rho_s \frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\eta}_s}{\partial t^2} - \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{F}_s\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s) = \boldsymbol{f}^t_s
++++

Add to this, the execution time as well as the degree of freedom and the number of element generated by the different steps of meshes and we will compare at the end the results with different meshes and a different polynomial degree in order to evaluate the time resolution.

The following graph shows the number of element and degree of freedom depending on the
mesh step during a performance test with a P1 polynomial degree using the FEEL ++ solver, applied to the Cantilever test case.
A performance test was launched with a mesh size stem:[h = 0.1] less at each step.
Note that, more the mesh is refined more the number of element increases and the degree of freedom also, which also leads to an increase in the number of equations to solve.

The data of a numerical problem usually depend on experimental measurements, that's whay, in general, it can be said that, the conditioning associated with a problem is a measure of the difficulty of a numerical calculation of the problem. A problem with a low conditioning is
Well packaged and a problem with high conditioning is said to be poorly conditioned.
 
The following graph shows the number of iteration according to the mesh step stem:[h], which evolves in an irregular way, because the condition number is linked to the mesh size (as h decreases, the condition number increases) and affects the convergence of iterative solvers (it inscreases with the condition number), that's explaine why the number of iterations increases by refining the mesh.

The next graph shows the execution time and the relative time according to the mesh step stem:[h]. We note that the execution time increases by refining the mesh this is due to the generated element numbers and therefore the number of equation to solve, and we see it well on the curve of relative time that evolves almost with the execution time, which will allow us to approximately the time of the next mesh, or the time evolution of the resolution in function of the mesh step.

The following figures show the results of table above on graphs for good realize that refining the mesh, the number of element and degree of freedom increase, and it is practically the same case as that with polynomial degree P1.
As to the number of iteration evolve differently according to stem:[h], but in the seems to increase too.

== Conclusion

To obtain these data, we used several refinements of meshes and different polynomial approximations to obtain the time of resolution of each one.

As expected from a theoretical point of view, the mesh size has a considerable influence on the results states, as you've seen it plays a very important role on the time of performance. 

We chose a simplified model for the project, which from this done well as part of the proposed study.
Finally, with these results we could see that the solver {feelpp} has a good calculation speed.
