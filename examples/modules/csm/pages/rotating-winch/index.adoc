= Rotating winch
:page-vtkjs: true


==  Introduction

Simulate the rotation around the center of one of the holes in a winch.

(18 degree ~ 18°/180°*π = 0.31415 -> 0.3)

== Model/Geometry

The first step is to create the model of the object, which we can simply do in the Inventor program. With this program was the fastest and easiest way to create the model.

The finished geometry (Inventor) and the meshed model (Gmsh):

==  Materials and boundary conditions

=== Materials

The beam is made of copper, so we need to use the following data:

* E = 124 GPa -> 124e3 N/mm^2^
* nu = 0.33
* rho = 8920 kg/m^3^ -> 8920e-9 kg/mm^3 ^

=== Boundary conditions

The center of one of the holes in a winch is fixed.

== Results


IMPORTANT: The result were run in time (a whole period, but on the pictures can be seen only a half period).


=== Displacement

The following pictures were made every 0.06 radians. The maximum rotation is 0.3 radians.
