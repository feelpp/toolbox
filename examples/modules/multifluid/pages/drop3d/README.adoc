= 3D Drop benchmark

The previous section described the strategy we used to track the interface. We
couple it now to the Navier Stokes equation solver described in
<<Chabannes>>. In the current section, we present a 3D extension of the 2D benchmark introduced in <<Hysing>> and realised using Feel++
in <<Doyeux>>.

== Benchmark problem

The benchmark objective is to simulate the rise of a 3D bubble in a Newtonian
fluid. The equations solved are the incompressible Navier Stokes equations for
the fluid and the advection for the level set:
[stem]
++++
\begin{array}[lll]
 \rho\rho(\phi(\mathbf{x}) ) \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) + \nabla p - \nabla \cdot \left( \nu(\phi(\mathbf{x})) (\nabla \mathbf{u} + (\nabla \mathbf{u})^T) \right) &=& \rho ( \phi(\mathbf{x}) ) \mathbf{g}, \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &=& 0, \\
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \phi &=& 0, 
\end{array}
++++
where stem:[\rho] is the density of the fluid, stem:[\nu] its viscosity, and stem:[\mathbf{g} \approx (0,
0.98)^T] is the gravity acceleration.

The computational domain is stem:[\Omega \times \rbrack0, T\rbrack ] where stem:[\Omega] is a cylinder which has a radius
stem:[R] and a heigth stem:[H] so that stem:[R=0.5] and stem:[H=2] and stem:[T=3]. We denote stem:[\Omega_1] the domain outside
the bubble stem:[ \Omega_1= \{\mathbf{x} | \phi(\mathbf{x})>0 \} ], stem:[\Omega_2] the domain inside the bubble stem:[
\Omega_2 = \{\mathbf{x} | \phi(\mathbf{x})<0 \} and stem:[\Gamma] the interface stem:[ \Gamma =
\{\mathbf{x} | \phi(\mathbf{x})=0 \} ].  On the lateral walls and on the bottom walls, no-slip boundary
conditions are imposed, *i.e.* stem:[\mathbf{u} = 0] and stem:[\mathbf{t} \cdot (\nabla
\mathbf{u} + (\nabla \mathbf{u})^T) \cdot \mathbf{n}=0] where stem:[\mathbf{n}] is the unit normal to
the interface and stem:[\mathbf{t}] the unit tangent. Neumann condition is
imposed on the top wall *i.e.* stem:[\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial \mathbf{n}}=\mathbf{0}]. The initial
bubble is circular with a radius stem:[r_0 = 0.25] and centered on the point stem:[(0.5, 0.5, 0.)].
A surface tension force stem:[\mathbf{f}_{st}] is applied on stem:[\Gamma], it reads :
stem:[\mathbf{f}_{st} = \int_{\Gamma} \sigma \kappa \mathbf{n} \simeq \int_{\Omega} \sigma
\kappa \mathbf{n} \delta_{\varepsilon}(\phi)] where stem:[\sigma] stands for the surface tension between the two-fluids and 
stem:[\kappa = \nabla \cdot (\frac{\nabla   \mathbf{\phi}}{|\nabla \phi|})] is the curvature of the interface. Note that the
 normal vector stem:[\mathbf{n}] is defined here as stem:[\mathbf{n}=\frac{\nabla \phi}{|\nabla \phi|}].

We denote with indices stem:[1] and stem:[2] the quantities relative to the fluid in respectively in stem:[\Omega_1] and stem:[\Omega_2]. The parameters of the benchmark are stem:[\rho_1], stem:[\rho_2], stem:[\nu_1], stem:[\nu_2] and stem:[\sigma] and we define two dimensionless numbers: first, the Reynolds number which is the  ratio between inertial and viscous terms and is defined as : 
stem:[Re = \dfrac{\rho_1 \sqrt{|\mathbf{g}|  (2r_0)^3}}{\nu_1}]; second, the Eötvös number which represents the ratio between the gravity force and the surface tension 
stem:[E_0 = \dfrac{4 \rho_1 |\mathbf{g}| r_0^2}{\sigma}]. 
The table below reports the values  of the parameters used for two different test cases proposed in <<Hysing>>.

The quantities measured in <<Hysing>> are stem:[\mathbf{X_c}] the center of mass
of the bubble, stem:[\mathbf{U_c}] its velocity and the circularity. For the 3D case
we extend the circularity to the sphericity defined as the ratio
between the surface of a sphere which has the same volume and the surface
of the bubble which reads stem:[\Psi(t) = \dfrac{4\pi\left(\dfrac{3}{4\pi} \int_{\Omega_2} 1 \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\int_{\Gamma} 1}].

== Simulations parameters

The simulations have been performed on the supercomputer SUPERMUC using 160 or 320
processors. The number of processors was chosen depending on the memory needed for
the simulations. The table <<TableModelingCFDMultiFluid3dDropParamTest1>> summarize for the test 1 the different simulation properties and the table <<TableModelingCFDMultiFluid3dDropMeshSize>> give the carachteristics of each mesh.

The Navier-Stokes equations are linearized using the Newton's method and we used a KSP method to
solve the linear system. We use an Additive Schwarz Method for the preconditioning (GASM)
and a LU method as a sub preconditionner.
We run the simulations looking for solutions in finite element spaces spanned by
Lagrange polynomials of order stem:[(2,1,1)] for respectively the velocity, the
pressure and the level set.

== Results Test 1: Ellipsoidal bubble

Accordind to the 2D results we expect that the drop would became ellipsoid. The
figure~\ref{subfig:elli_sh} shows the shape of the drop at the final time step.
The contour is quite similar to the one we obtained in the two dimensions simulations.
The shapes are similar and seems to converge when the mesh size is decreasing.
The drop reaches a stationary circularity and its topology does not change.
The velocity increases until it attains a constant value. Figure~\ref{subfig:elli_uc}
shows the results we obtained with different mesh sizes.
