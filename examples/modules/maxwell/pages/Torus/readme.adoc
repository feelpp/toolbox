= Torus Benchmark

We need to verify our implementation against physical configuration, we choose to compute the potential vector and the magnetic flux of a torus. This is an axisymmettric configuration and we will work on a quarter of it.

== Description

We want to resolve the Maxwell's equations presented in link:Maxwell.adox[Maxwell] and compare them with some exact solutions given by C. Trophime using Bmap.

> **TODO** references for solutions and bmap

The condition stem:[\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{n}=0] on stem:[\partial\Omega] must be set at the infinity, which is computationally impossible. So we create a sphere around our region of interest to simulate the infinity. This restriction induces an error. +
The goal here is to see the influence of the radius of the external sphere on the results.

The following figure presents the geometry used. The left part represents a side view, and the right part, an upside view. +

stem:[\Omega=\Omega_c\cup\Omega_n\cup\Omega_f] where stem:[\Omega_c] is the coil, stem:[\Omega_n] the domain near the coil, where the mesh is thin, stem:[\Omega_f] where the mesh is coarse. stem:[\partial\Omega=\Gamma_s\cup\Gamma_\infty] where stem:[\Gamma_\infty] represents the infinity, we can change stem:[R_\infty] to study its influence on the results, and stem:[\Gamma_s] is the boundary due to the symmetry.

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* on stem:[\Gamma_\infty], we chose our potential vector to be null:

[stem]
++++
  \mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{n} = 0
++++

* on stem:[\Gamma_s], due to the symmetry of the geometry, we have also:

[stem]
++++
  \mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{n} = 0
++++
* and in the saddle-point case, on stem:[\partial\Omega],

[stem]
++++
  p = 0
++++

== Inputs

- Parameter set definition

We impose the electric current on the coil, stem:[\Omega_c]. We use two different current, an uniform electric current stem:[J_1], and a non uniform current stem:[J_2].

.Fixed and Variable Input Parameters
|===
| Name |Description | Nominal Value | Range | Units

|stem:[J_1] | uniform electric current | stem:[\frac{12.10^{6}}{\pi\sqrt{x^2+y^2} }\begin{pmatrix} -y\\ x\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}] | | stem:[\frac{A}{m^2}]
|stem:[J_2] | non uniform electric current | stem:[\frac{12.10e{^6}}{\pi\left(x^2+y^2\right)}\begin{pmatrix} -y\\ x\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}] | | stem:[\frac{A}{m^2}]
|stem:[R] | external radius | | stem:[[0.2:0.2:0.8]] |stem:[m]

- Solver and preconditioner used

The solver and preconditionner are the ones detail in link:../Strategy.adoc[Resolution Strategy]

== Outputs

Two metrics are of interests, the relative error on the potential

[stem]
++++
  \frac{||\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{A}_{ex}||_{L_2}}{||\mathbf{A}_{ex}||_{L_2}}
++++
and the relative error on the magnetic flux

[stem]
++++
  \frac{||\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{B}_{ex}||_{L_2}}{||\mathbf{B}_{ex}||_{L_2}}
++++

These errors can be computed either in the whole domain, stem:[\Omega], either in a ball inside of the region of interest, stem:[B(R_{int})], that is, inside the torus (in our case stem:[R_{int}=0.0306]) +
In a physical point of view, the later is more natural because this is where we need to know what happens.

== Discretization

We use differents size for the external sphere's *Radius*, stem:[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8], and different characteristic *size* for the mesh. Which give the following problems' sizes, in terms of degrees of freedom for *Nedelec* elements, *Lagrange* elements and number of *Elements*.

== Results

=== Potential vector

The regularized formulation does not make sense for the potential, since it is known up to a gradient. +
The following figures present the errors depending on the current and the domain in which the error is computed. Each figure shows the error depending on the mesh size for the differents external radius stem:[R_\infty]. The two first figures exhibit the behavior of the saddle point formulation, whereas the last two, exhibit the regularized formulation.

== Conclusion

We can extract here some results:

- the formulation or the type of current has no influence on the results,
- the difference between the errors computed in stem:[\Omega] and in stem:[B(R_{int})], a factor 4 for stem:[\mathbf{B}] and 10 for stem:[\mathbf{A}], shows that the errors occure in particular in stem:[\Omega_f]. This is due to the approximation on the boundary condition on stem:[\Gamma_\infty],
- the distance stem:[R_\infty] allows to have better approximations as it grows, until it reachs a certain bound, between stem:[0.4] and stem:[0.6] depending on the characteristic size of the mesh
