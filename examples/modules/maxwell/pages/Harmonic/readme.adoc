= Harmonic Content & Multipoles magnets

The magnetic field can be expressed on specific basis functions.
We have identified two famillies of such basis:

- cylindrical, 
- spherical.

Decomposing a field on a basis allows to express the field with only the coefficient in the basis.
Moreover, the knowledge of few fields measurements - actually the order of precision we want to achieve on the basis function - provide us the _full_ knwoledge of the field.

To achieve dimensionless unit for the coefficient of the basis function, the field is conveniently scaled with a reference field and radius *that have to be specified* to fully understand the decomposition.

## Cylindrical.

Considering a two dimensional multipole fields, one can show we have - writting stem:[\mathbf{B} = \left(B_x, B_y, B_z\right)] with stem:[B_z] constant - the relation:
[stem]
++++
B_y + i B_x = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n \left(x + i y\right)^{n-1}
++++
in the vacuum.

It can be very convenient to write this in the polar coordinates :
[stem]
++++
B_{\theta} + i B_r = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n r^{n-1} e^{i n \theta}
++++

At least, if the field is measured at stem:[P] equally-spaced points around a circle of radius stem:[R_{meas}], we can use the Fast Fourrier Transform to evaluate the stem:[C_n] parameters.

We have to provide the various stem:[C_n] coefficient (real and imaginary parts) at various altitude to fully present the field.

The method is decribed in _Determination of magnetic multipoles using a hall probe_ and _Maxwell's equations for magnets_.

**Remark**

A pure multipole magnet of order stem:[n] has only stem:[C_n \neq 0] (stem:[C_2 \neq 0] for a dipole, stem:[C_3] for a sextupole and so on).

## Spherical.

To do.
