== Description
stem:[\quad] In this example, we will build a drug delivery in a coronary stent model. 

stem:[\quad] A drug-eluting stent is used to re-open the vessel in a occuled artery for blood flow. This stent slowly release drugs to prevent scar tissue formation and keep the artery open. Typcally, we use pactitaxel or sirolimus and its analogues including everolimus.  We wish to implement a simplified model of such a system to determine the blood drug distribution as a function of time along the artery. We have this PDE:
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla c = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c)
\end{equation}
++++

For the velocity, we have this profile:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  u = \frac{u_{max}}{R^2} (R^2 - r^2 )
\end{equation}
++++
where stem:[u] is the velocity in the axial direction, stem:[u_{max}] is the maximum velocity (=50 stem:[cm^{-1}]), stem:[R] is the arterial radius (=1mm), and r is the radial distance from the central axis.

We use a mono-exponential decay of stent drug-content:
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  M = M_0 exp(-kt)
\end{equation}
++++




stem:[\quad] The duration is stem:[10^5s]. Thus, we use a time step of stem:[1e^{-4}s] to see the variation under 1s, and a time step of 1s for the rest.

== Result
We obtain those curves:


.Illustration
|====
a|image:stent/result_0-1s.png[400,400]  | image:stent/result_0-1e5s.png[400,400]
|====

We can see that the maximum value is about stem:[3,3 \times 10^{-6} mol. m^{-3}]

And if we recombine the 2 curves, and adjust the value in the beginning of the part 2, we obtain this curve:

|====
a|image:stent/result_combined.png[600,600]
|====

and at 100000s we have this distribution:

|====
a|image:stent/result_1e5s.png[600,600]
