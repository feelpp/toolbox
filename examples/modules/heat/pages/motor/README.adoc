== Main Objectives



The main objective of this case is to develop a thermal model for finding the
temperature distribution of different components of an electric motor during
its various operating conditions and to determine the heat removal by natural
convection from the machine surface.

The application allows the predictions of simultaneous heat transfer in solid
and fluid media with energy exchange between them. The prediction of the
temperature distribution inside an operating electric motor is required at the
machine design stage. Excessive temperature in the motor can cause electrical
insulation failure, demagnetization of the magnets and increase in Joule
losses.

As shown in Fig. 1, the electric motor model has a very complicated geometry.
Obviously, it is not possible to perform simulation on the entire PM motor, due
to the large number of volumes and calculations required.
Therefore, a part of the PM motor consisting of each part (front cover, stator core, stator windings, rotor, permanent magnets, shaft, external housing and the air-gap
between these components are modelled for this study as shown on the <<fig-2,Fig. 2>>.
<<fig-3,Fig. 3>>. shows a detailed view of the main components of the modeled electric
motor.

Model detail includes; (1) the front cover, (2) and (5) the external housing
geometry, (3) the stator core geometry including slot detail and the stator
windings, (4) the rotor geometry including permanent magnets and shaft. In
order to simplify the model, the winding region was modeled as a solid section
and the end winding region was modeled as a torus. This assumption made this
motor element easier to mesh.

As shown in <<fig-4,Fig. 4>>, the mesh for the motor and the air-gap was created based on
tetrahedral elements, as these are the only elements capable of meshing that
domain.
