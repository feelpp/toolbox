We took this example from : [Socrates_Dokos_(auth.)]_Modelling_Organs,_Tissues(z-lib.org) .

== Description
stem:[\quad]In this example, we will build a diffusion and uptake into a spherical cell model. We will use Fick's laws of diffusion.

stem:[\quad] Fickâ€™s second law describes the transient changes of concentration with time, and is written mathematically as a PDE in the concentration variable c:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c)
\end{equation}
++++
with stem:[D]  the diffusion coefficient of the substance in a given medium in SI units of stem:[m^{2}s^{-1}]. The typical values for stem:[D] are stem:[[ 0.6 \times 10^{-9}, 2 \times 10^{-9}]]  stem:[m^{2}s^{-1}] for individual ions and stem:[[ 10^{-11}, 10^{-10}]]  stem:[m^{2}s^{-1}] for biological molecules.

We obtain an equation similar to heat transfert. Thus we will use the toolbox `heat`.

For the  Boundary Conditions, we have the typical value for cell surface: stem:[-0,0005c \ mol\ s^{-1}m^{-2}] where stem:[c] is the nutriment concentration in stem:[mM]

stem:[\quad] We consider a spherical cell of radius stem:[50 \mu m] taking a nutrient from the interstitial space and metabolising it. The initial concentration in the interstitial space is stem:[100 mM], we try to find the concentration of nutrient stem:[0.5 \mu m] from the cell surface as a function of the time.


=== Running the model 
The command line to run this case is


[[command-line]]
[source,sh]

mpirun -np 16 feelpp_toolbox_heat --case "github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/heat/examples/cell}"
----

=== Geometry
We have the  interstitial space and the cell-membrane as shown below

== Input
As we have this value stem:[-0,0005c \ mol\ s^{-1}m^{-2}] for the boundary condition, we use Robin condition for the bondary condition:
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    - k \nabla c \cdot n = H(c - G)
\end{equation}
++++
and for thr PDE:
[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c)
\end{equation}
++++
We will use those inputs:

| Name     | Description | Values            | Units

Here we suppose that the concentration inside the cell is equal to 0, but we can change it.

----
<1> Name of the example, usually printed on-screen and in log files during simulations

==== Materials

This section of the Model JSON file defines material properties linking the Physical Entities in the mesh data structures to these properties.

=== CFG file

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.

The Cfg file used is
----
directory=Cell3DExport <1>
case.dimension=3 <2>
[heat] <3>
mesh.filename=$cfgdir/cellule3d.geo <4>
gmsh.hsize=5e-7#0.01#0.05 <5>
filename=$cfgdir/cellule3d.json <6>
initial-solution.temperature=100 <7>
reuse-prec=1 <8>
pc-type=gamg <9>

[heat.bdf] <10>

[ts] <12>

restart.at-last-save=true <15>
----
<1> the directory where the results are exported 
<2>	the dimension of the application, by default 3D
<3> toolbox prefix
<4> the geometric file
<5> the mesh step
<6> the associated Json file
<7> the initial solution: here the temperature take the role of the concentration
<8> to reuse the precedent solution

<10> heat.bdf
<11> heat.bdf order
<12> time setup
<13> time step
<14> time final

We didn't configure the solver, cause in this case, the system is linear, and by default the solver chosen is the linear one.

== Result
We obtain this distribution of concentration at stem:[t = 0.001s] and the concentration as a function of time at a point located stem:[0.5\ \mu m] from the spherical cell boundary:
