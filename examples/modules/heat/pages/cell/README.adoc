== Description
stem:[\quad]In this example, we will build a diffusion and uptake into a spherical cell model. We will use Fick's laws of diffusion.

stem:[\quad] Fickâ€™s second law describes the transient changes of concentration with time, and is written mathematically as a PDE in the concentration variable c:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla c)
\end{equation}
++++
with stem:[D]  the diffusion coefficient of the substance in a given medium in SI units of stem:[m^{2}s^{-1}].

We obtain an equation similar to heat transfert. Thus we will use the toolbox `heat`.

stem:[\quad] We consider a spherical cell of radius stem:[50 \mu m] taking a nutrient from the interstitial space and metabolising it. The initial concentration in the interstitial space is stem:[100 mM], we try to find the concentration of nutrient stem:[0.5 \mu m] from the cell surface as a function of the time.

stem:[\quad] The 2D case is just a try to simplify the model.

=== Json file
==== Names 

A model JSON file starts by giving names (long and short).
----

"Name": " Diffusion and Uptake into a Spherical Cell", <1>
"ShortName":"Cell",<2>
----
<1> Name of the example, usually printed on-screen and in log files during simulations
<2> Short name of the example, it is used to create directories to store the results of the simulation of the model



==== Materials

This section of the Model JSON file defines material properties linking the Physical Entities in the mesh data structures to these properties.

//.Example of Materials section
[source,json]

----
"Materials":
    {
        "fluid":<1>
        {
	    "markers":"fluid", <1>

            "k":"5e-9", <3>
            "Cp":"1" <2>
        }
    }
----
<1> gives the name of the physical entity (here `Physical Surface`) associated to the Material.
<2> stem:[\rho]  and stem:[C_p] equal to 1 and stem:[\mu] equals to 0  to have the similarity between the heat transfert equation and Fick's law of diffusion.
<3> here stem:[k] take the role of stem:[D].


==== Boundary Conditions

This section of the Model JSON file defines the boundary conditions.

[source,json]
//.Example of a `BoundaryConditions` section
----
"BoundaryConditions":
    {
        "temperature": <1>
        {
             "Neumann": <2>

                }
            }
        }
    },

----
<1> the field name of the toolbox to which the boundary condition is associated
<2> the type of boundary condition to apply, here `Neumann`
<3> the physical entity (associated to the mesh) to which the condition is applied
<4> the mathematical expression associated to the condition

In the 2D case, we try to use the radius: -7.071e-2.

=== CFG file

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.

The Cfg file used in the 2D case is
----
directory=pipestokes  <1>
case.dimension=2 <2>
[fluid] <3>
filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.json <4>
mesh.filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.geo <5>
gmsh.hsize=0.1 <6>
pc-type=lu #gasm,lu <7>

directory=Cell2DExport <1>
case.dimension=2 <2>
[heat] <3>
mesh.filename=$cfgdir/cellule2d_quart.geo <4>
gmsh.hsize=1e-7#0.01#0.05 <5>
filename=$cfgdir/cellule2d.json <6>
initial-solution.temperature=100 <7>
reuse-prec=1 <8>
pc-type=gamg <9>

[heat.bdf] <10>
order=2 <11>

[ts] <12>
time-step=1e-5 <13>
time-final=1e-3 <14>
restart.at-last-save=true <15>
----
<1> the directory where the results are exported 
<2>	the dimension of the application, by default 3D
<3> toolboxe prefix 
<4> the geometric file
<5> the mesh step
<6> the associated Json file
<7> the initial solution: here the temperature take the role of the concentration
<8> to reuse the precedent solution
<9> the chosen method for decomposition
<10> heat.bdf
<11> heat.bdf order
<12> time setup
<13> time step
<14> time final
<15> restart at last save


The cfg file for the 3D case is the almost the same as 2D case, just change case.dimension=2 into case.dimension=3.


We didn't configure the solver, cause in this case, the system is linear, and by default the solver chosen is the linear one.

== Result
We obtain this distribution of concentration at stem:[t = 0.001s] and the concentration as a function of time at a point located stem:[0.5\ \mu m] from the spherical cell boundary:
