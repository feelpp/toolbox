= Stokes Boundary Layer Benchmark

Analysis Type: Oscillatory motion of viscous boundary layer

WARNING: this benchmark has been published by NAFEMS, it has not yet been implemented/tested using {feelpp}
 


== Introduction
The Stokes oscillating plate case is one of the few transient flow examples that offer a closed-form solution for laminar flow over a smooth solid wall.
The fluid motion, which is stimulated by an oscillating boundary, is dominated by viscous forces. It can be shown that the system of transport equations is reduced to a diffusion equation for a single velocity component [1,2]
The integration of the diffusion equation over a longer time interval shall expose numerical diffusion of the applied spatial and temporal discretisation.

== Objectives


Examine the accuracy of transient solver and the extent of false, numerical diffusion by comparing the velocity distribution throughout the simulation time interval with the analytical solution. The numerical error is manifested by the accelerated velocity decay and the phase shift of the oscillatory motion.

== Geometry

image::stokes_boundary_layer/geometry.png[Geometry]

* Length of the simulation domain stem:[(\mathrm{H} 6)] is stem:[8.0 \mathrm{m}]
* Domain height (V7) is 5.0 stem:[\mathrm{m}]
* Domain width stem:[0.2 \mathrm{m}] (although not important due to the case twodimensionality).

== Case Definition

Sinusoidal oscillations in the stem:[x] -direction are forced by prescribing a plate velocity function stem:[u=U_{0} \sin (2 \pi f t)] to the bottom surface where:

* stem:[U_{0}] is the velocity amplitude set to stem:[1.0 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}] 
* stem:[f] is the forced oscillation frequency set to stem:[1.0 \mathrm{Hz}]
* stem:[t] is time.


== Fluid Properties
Propagation of the low speed oscillatory motion depends solely on kinematic viscosity of the fluid:

* stem:[v] is kinematic viscosity of stem:[1.0 \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}] (comparable to glycerol).

== Initial Conditions

Zero velocity ( stem:[u] ) and relative pressure ( stem:[p_{r e l}] ) for the whole domain.

== Boundary Conditions

* The bottom plate has a prescribed velocity 
* stem:[u=U_{0} \sin (2 \pi f t)] with no slip boundary conditions.
* At the top surface, slip boundary conditions shall be used.
* The vertical stem:[Y-Z] surfaces at stem:[x=x_{\min }] and stem:[x_{m a x}] have periodic boundary conditions 
* For the streamwise velocity stem:[\left(u_{1}=u_{2}\right)] assigned to them.
* For the vertical stem:[X] -Y surfaces, the symmetry or equivalent conditions shall be used.

== Output

The analytical solution is stem:[u=U_{0} e^{-k y} \sin (2 \pi f t-k y)] where:

* stem:[k=\sqrt{\pi f / v}] is the wave number;
* stem:[v] is fluid kinematic viscosity. 

The velocity distribution should be compared to the analytical solution at different heights stem:[(y)] in the simulation domain. The following elevations are advised:
stem:[y=0.1,0.2,0.4,0.8] and stem:[2.0 \mathrm{m}]

Dissipation of the velocity amplitude relative to the analytical solution stem:[\left(u_{n u m} / u-1\right)] as well its phase shift stem:[(\Delta t)] should be calculated. The smaller the velocity amplitude difference and the phase shift, the lower the numerical diffusion.
