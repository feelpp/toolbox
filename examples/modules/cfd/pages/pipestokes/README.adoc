== Data files
=== Json file
==== Names and Type of Model

A model JSON file starts by giving names (long and short) as well as the type of model which will be used by the toolbox.
The latter allows to configure the set of equations associated the toolbox physics.

=== CFG file

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.

The Cfg file used in this benchmark 
----
directory=pipestokes  <1>
case.dimension=2 <2>
[fluid] <3>
filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.json <4>
mesh.filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.geo <5>
gmsh.hsize=0.1 <6>
pc-type=lu #gasm,lu <7>
----
<1> the directory where the results are exported 
<2>	the dimension of the application, by default 3D
<3> toolboxe prefix 
<4> the associated Json file 
<5> the geometric file 
<6> the mesh step
<7> the chosen method for decomposition

We didn't configure the solver, cause in this case, the systeme is linear, and by default the solver chosen is the linear one.

== Geometry & Input parameters

=== Model & Toolbox

We consider a 2D model representative of a pipe, the flow domain is contained into the rectangle stem:[ \lbrack 0,length \rbrack \times \lbrack 0,height \rbrack ]. and it's caracterised by it's dynamique viscpsity stem:[\boldsymbol{\mu}].
we chosed for this case the stokes model.

image::pipestokes/newfigure.png[alt="Figure",align="center"]

We remind the stokes model

[stem]
++++
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
   \boldsymbol{\mu}\boldsymbol{\Delta u}+\boldsymbol{\nabla p}=f\\
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
++++
 
with stem:[\boldsymbol{\mu}] is the dynamic viscosity, stem:[\boldsymbol{p}] is the pressure ,stem:[f] the source and u the velocity.

=== Initial conditions
* The fact that we are not considering the time evolution in this case, 
we have stem:[v_{inlet}] = stem:[D] stem:[y(height-y)]. To determine stem:[D], we know that for stem:[y=\frac{height}{2}] we have the maximal velocity, so 

[stem]
++++
D=\frac{v_{max}}{\frac{height}{2}\left(height-\frac{height}{2}\right)}
++++

* In this case, there is no source term so, stem:[f=0].

=== Boundary conditions
* On **wall**, a homogenous Dirichlet condition stem:[\boldsymbol{u}=0]
* On **outlet**, a Newmann condition stem:[\boldsymbol{\sigma} . \boldsymbol{n}=0], where stem:[\sigma=-pI_d+2\mu D(\boldsymbol{u})] and stem:[D(\boldsymbol{u})=\frac{1}{2}(\nabla \boldsymbol{u}+\nabla \boldsymbol{u}^{T})],  stem:[\sigma ]  is the contraints tensor and stem:[D] is the deformation tensor.
* On **inlet**, an inflow Dirichlet condition :
 stem:[ \boldsymbol{u}=(v_{in},0) ]



== Benchmark
=== Results

We find the Results in "/feel/pipestokes/np_1/fluid.exports", if we want to show the figure using Paraview we have to use the file Export.case
Using height=1, lenght=5 and vmax=1 we found thoses figures 
 
* For the pressure

image::pipestokes/pression.png[alt="Pressure",align="center"] 

* For the velocity 

image::pipestokes/vitesse.png[alt="Velocity",align="center"]

we can also show the arrows to see the direction of the flow, the figure below that the directions is from the left to the right, which means that the theory expectation
are verified, I mean by the theory expectation  that the flow of blood must go from the highest pression to the lowest.


image::pipestokes/arrow.png[alt="Direction of the flow",align="center"] 

Using height=3, lenght=5 and vmax=1, to change it we can use 
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case "github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/cfd/examples/pipestokes}"  --fluid.gmsh.geo-variables-list="height=3" --json-editions Parameters.height:3
----
* For the pressure

image::pipestokes/pression2.png[alt="Pressure",align="center"] 

* For the velocity

image::pipestokes/vitesse2.png[alt="Velocity",align="center"] 

=== Issues

We notice in the case above, the presence of two white points on the top of the outlet, we can also see the deflection of the arrows in the figure above. which is not normal, the probleme is in the bondary conditions, precisly the outlet one.
besides,we added the calculation of the error in the file json

Three solutions were suggested by PRUD'HOMME and CHABANNES
  
==== First case

Instead of putting stem:[\sigma.n=0], We calculate the expression of stem:[\sigma] and put the exact expression.

The command line to run this case is

[[command-line]]
[source,sh]
----
mpirun -np 4 feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case "github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/cfd/examples/pipestokes/case_corrections/naumann}" 
----



We already know the expression of stem:[u=Dy(1-y)], and we know that the pression p is linear so stem:[p=ax+b]. + 
The first equation of stokes give us that stem:[f=-\mu\Delta u+\nabla p], we have stem:[\nabla p=(a,0)] and stem:[\Delta u=(-2D,0)]. +
so stem:[f=(2\mu D+a,0)], in our case we had no external force (stem:[f=0]), to respect that, we have to choose a=-2\mu D. +
To detect the expression of b, we assumed that the pressure has a zero average, it means that 
[stem]:
++++
 \begin{array}{rcr}
\frac{1}{\Omega}\int_{\Omega}p=0 & \Rightarrow \int_{0}^{height}\int_{0}^{lenght} -2\mu Dx+b \quad dx dy=0 \\
& \Rightarrow  height[-2\frac{1}{2}\mu Dx^{2}+bx]_{0}^{lenght}=0 \\
& \Rightarrow -height *\mu D *lenght^{2}+b*lenght=0
\end{array}
++++
So stem:[b*lenght=height* \mu D*lenght^{2}], b=stem:[heigh \mu D*lenght] + 
The expression of p is p=-2 stem:[\mu Dx+height*\mu *D* lenght].
  
We know that stem:[\sigma.n=-pI_{d}+2\mu D(u)]
we calculate D(u)
[stem]
++++
D(u)=\frac{1}{2}
 \left(
  \begin{array}{ c c }
     0 & D-2Dy  \\
     D-2Dy & 0
  \end{array} \right)
++++

So 
[stem]
++++
\sigma =
 \left(
  \begin{array}{ c c }
     -p & \mu(D-2Dy)  \\
     \mu(D-2Dy)& -p
  \end{array} \right)

++++

On as 
[stem]
++++
n_{out}=\left(
  \begin{array}{ c c }
     1  \\
     0
  \end{array} \right)
++++

So
[stem]
++++
\sigma.n_{out}=\left(
  \begin{array}{ c c }
     -p  \\
     \mu(D-2Dy)
  \end{array} \right)

++++

That's means that
[stem]
++++
\sigma.n_{out}=\left(
  \begin{array}{ c c }
     2\mu Dx-height*\mu D *lenght \\
     \mu (D-2Dy)
  \end{array} \right)
++++

For the data files the cfg didn't change, we changed just the boundary conditions in the json, precisely the outlet condition.

==== Second case

We put Dirichlet conditions everywhere, we know that the velocity is quadratic, so the velocity in outlet is the same that the one in inlet.

The command line to run this case is

image::pipestokes/arrow_dirichlet.png[alt="Direction of the flow",align="center"] 

==== Third case

We fixe that the tengential velocity is null and we fixe a value for p.

=== Comparison

We saw that in CFG file, we can choose between two decomposition LU and Gasm, in the theory, the option Gasm is faster than LU, in fact Gasm decompose the domaine and it use LU in every part in parallel. 

We decide to refine the mesh and compare the run time for both options.

image::pipestokes/Figure_1.png[alt="Curve",align="center"]

we notice that the execution time decreases for both options, when the mesh step becomes coarse, which coincides with the theoretical results. And we can see also that the curve corresponds to the Gasm method is faster.

image::pipestokes/Figure_2.png[alt="Curve",align="center"]

The curve above corresponds to the time difference between the two methods, we can see that when the mesh step is large, the time differance is really small, on the other hand the time differance is big when the step mesh is small.
