== Data files
=== Json file
==== Names and Type of Model

A model JSON file starts by giving names (long and short) as well as the type of model which will be used by the toolbox.
The latter allows to configure the set of equations associated the toolbox physics.
[source,json]
----
"Name": "Stockes flow in a pipe", <1>
"ShortName":"pipestokes", <2>
"Models": <3>
{
   "equations":"Stokes" <4>
}
----
<1> Name of the example, usually printed on-screen and in log files during simulations
<2> Short name of the example, it is used to create directories to store the results of the simulation of the model
<3> Section `Models` defined by the toolbox to define the main configuration of a toolbox and in particular the set of equations to be solved
<4> toolbox specific option to define set of equations to be solved, read the toolbox manual to learn about the possible options.

==== Parameters

This section of the Model JSON file defines the parameters that may enter expressions used in the subsequent sections.

----
<1> the name of the section
<2> the `Exports` identifies the toolbox fields that have to be exported for visualisation
<3> the list of fields to be exported

=== CFG file

The Model CFG (`.cfg`) files allow to pass command line options to {feelpp} applications. In particular, it allows to

* setup the mesh
* define the solution strategy and configure the linear/non-linear algebraic solvers.

The Cfg file used in this benchmark 
----
directory=pipestokes  <1>
case.dimension=2 <2>
[fluid] <3>
filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.json <4>
mesh.filename=$cfgdir/pipestokes.geo <5>
gmsh.hsize=0.1 <6>
pc-type=lu #gasm,lu <7>
----
<1> the directory where the results are exported 
<2>	the dimension of the application, by default 3D
<3> toolboxe prefix 
<4> the associated Json file 
<5> the geometric file 
<6> the mesh step
<7> the chosen method for decomposition

We didn't configure the solver, cause in this case, the systeme is linear, and by default the solver chosen is the linear one.

== Geometry & Input parameters

=== Model & Toolbox

We consider a 2D model representative of a pipe, the flow domain is contained into the rectangle stem:[ \lbrack 0,length \rbrack \times \lbrack 0,height \rbrack ]. and it's caracterised by it's dynamique viscpsity stem:[\boldsymbol{\mu}].
we chosed for this case the stokes model.

image::pipestokes/newfigure.png[alt="Figure",align="center"]

We remind the stokes model

[stem]
++++
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
   \boldsymbol{\mu}\boldsymbol{\Delta u}+\boldsymbol{\nabla p}=f\\
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
++++
 
with stem:[\boldsymbol{\mu}] is the dynamic viscosity, stem:[\boldsymbol{p}] is the pressure ,stem:[f] the source and u the velocity.

=== Initial conditions
* The fact that we are not considering the time evolution in this case, 
we have stem:[v_{inlet}] = stem:[D] stem:[y(height-y)]. To determine stem:[D], we know that for stem:[y=\frac{height}{2}] we have the maximal velocity, so 

[stem]
++++
D=\frac{v_{max}}{\frac{height}{2}\left(height-\frac{height}{2}\right)}
++++

* In this case, there is no source term so, stem:[f=0].

=== Boundary conditions
* On **wall**, a homogenous Dirichlet condition stem:[\boldsymbol{u}=0]
* On **outlet**, a Newmann condition stem:[\boldsymbol{\sigma} . \boldsymbol{n}=0], where stem:[\sigma=-pI_d+2\mu D(\boldsymbol{u})] and stem:[D(\boldsymbol{u})=\frac{1}{2}(\nabla \boldsymbol{u}+\nabla \boldsymbol{u}^{T})],  stem:[\sigma ]  is the contraints tensor and stem:[D] is the deformation tensor.
* On **inlet**, an inflow Dirichlet condition :
 stem:[ \boldsymbol{u}=(v_{in},0) ]



== Benchmark
=== Results

We find the Results in "/feel/pipestokes/np_1/fluid.exports", if we want to show the figure using Paraview we have to use the file Export.case
Using height=1, lenght=5 and vmax=1 we found thoses figures 
 
* For the pressure

image::pipestokes/pression.png[alt="Pressure",align="center"] 

* For the velocity 

image::pipestokes/vitesse.png[alt="Velocity",align="center"]

we can also show the arrows to see the direction of the flow, the figure below that the directions is from the left to the right, which means that the theory expectation
are verified, I mean by the theory expectation  that the flow of blood must go from the highest pression to the lowest.


image::pipestokes/arrow.png[alt="Direction of the flow",align="center"] 

Using height=3, lenght=5 and vmax=1, to change it we can use 
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case "github:{repo:toolbox,path:examples/modules/cfd/examples/pipestokes}"  --fluid.gmsh.geo-variables-list="height=3" --json-editions Parameters.height:3
----
* For the pressure

image::pipestokes/pression2.png[alt="Pressure",align="center"] 

* For the velocity

=== Comparison

We saw that in CFG file, we can choose between two decomposition LU and Gasm, in the theory, the option Gasm is faster than LU, in fact Gasm decompose the domaine and it use LU in every part in parallel. 

We decide to refine the mesh and compare the run time for both options.

image::pipestokes/Figure_1.png[alt="Curve",align="center"]

we notice that the execution time decreases for both options, when the mesh step becomes coarse, which coincides with the theoretical results. And we can see also that the curve corresponds to the Gasm method is faster.

image::pipestokes/Figure_2.png[alt="Curve",align="center"]

The curve above corresponds to the time difference between the two methods, we can see that when the mesh step is large, the time differance is really small, on the other hand the time differance is big when the step mesh is small.
