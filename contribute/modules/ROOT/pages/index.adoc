= Multi-Physics Toolboxes Contribution Guide


In the spirit of free software, everyone is encouraged to help improve our Multi-Physics toolboxes. New contributors are always welcome!
Here, we discuss the different ways to contribute to {feelpp} multiphysics toolboxes. You can contribute

* [x] <<contrib-desc,case descriptions>>
* [x] <<contrib,case implementation and documentation>>
* [x] feature requests
* [x] bug reports

We start first with explaining the difference between an example and a benchmark.


[[diff-ex-bench]]
== What is the difference between an example and a benchmark?


A benchmark is  essentially an example which contains data that allows to either:

* verify that the model(the equation set) was solved correctly, this is called **verification**. Synthetic data is provided to make the verification or data provived by another software
* verify that the model solved is the correct one, this is called **validation**. Experimental data is provided to make the validation or data provided by another software which have been validated.
* verify that the performance of the model scale properly, this includes weak and strong scalability benchmarking.

[[contrib-desc]]
== How to contribute a case description?

Anyone can propose or suggest a new example to be added to the {feelpp} toolbox repository.
To do so, start a https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/issues[new issue] and select the https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/issues/new?template=example.md[Example Request] template.
You just then have to fill out the example or benchmark request.


NOTE: The answers provided can, almost directly, be used to document the xref:templates/case.adoc[case documentation file].

[[contrib]]
== How to contribute a case?

To contribute a case description, you need to follow the steps:

* [x] <<_toolbox,identify the {feelpp} toolbox>> to which the case with be added
* [x] <<_documentation_setup,setup the documentation>>
* [x] <<_implementation,implement the example>>
* [x] <<_documenting_numerical_results,document the numerical results>>
* [x] <<_submission,submit a Pull Request (PR)>>

But first you need to understand the file organization of the examples and benchmarks directory tree.

=== File organization

IMPORTANT: It is important that you read https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/component-structure/[Antora File Organization] section before continuing.

This is how the `examples` tree directory may look like
[source,txt]
--
include::{examplesdir}/tree-example.txt[]
--
<1> example module for the computational fluid dynamic (cfd) toolbox
<2> `examples` contains the examples input dataset
<3> example directory `flow_past_cylinder` containing the configuration files (`cfg`, `json`, `geo`, ...)
<4> `pages` contains the documentation pages where Antora look into to transform `.adoc` files into `.html` files
<5> example module for the computational solid mechanics (csm) toolbox
<6> the `assets` directory contains images or data associated to the examples.
<7> the `assets/images` contains the images of each example
<8> the images of each example are organized by directory named using the slug name of the example,
<9> each example documentation is located in a topic directory named using the slug name of the example. The topic directory contains `.adoc` files.

NOTE: the slug name of a `case` does not contain spaces or dots or any special characters and can for example be used in url.

=== Toolbox

You need to identify which toolbox the example belongs to.
here is the list of **slug toolbox name**:

cfd:: xref:toolboxes:cfd:index.adoc[Computational Fluid Dynamics]
csm:: xref:toolboxes:csm:index.adoc[Computation Solid Mechanics]
heat:: xref:toolboxes:heat:index.adoc[Heat transfer]
heatfluid:: xref:toolboxes:heatfluid:index.adoc[Heat and CFD coupling]
fsi:: xref:toolboxes:fsi:index.adoc[Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI)], CFD and CSM coupling
thermoelectric:: xref:toolboxes:thermoelectric:index.adoc[Electrostatic and heat coupling]


The example is then located in the model named after The slug name of the toolbox:
----
examples/modules/<slug toolbox name>
----

=== Documentation setup

Follow the steps to setup the documentation:

* clone the `feelpp/toolbox` repository

* create a branch `case-#nn-<shortname>-<toolbox shortname>` where
** `#nn` is the corresponding issue number in github
** `<shortname>` is the code name of the case
** `<toolbox shortname>` is the code name of the toolbox used, it is optional

* edit in `antora.yml` the field `version` and use `<latest version>-case-#nn-<shortname>`, `<latest version>` meaning the latest version number upon which we build the documentation, _e.g_ `0.105`. The work done in the branch will appear in the documentation under development.
+
here is an example
----
0.105-case-20-cylinder
----

* create a topic in `[examples]/modules/<toolbox>/pages/<short name>/README.adoc

* start filling up `README.adoc` using the xref:templates/case.adoc[case template file].



=== Implementation

Follow this step :

* create the geometry (_e.g._ `.geo`), `.cfg` and `.json` files to `cases/modules/<slug toolbox name>/examples/<slug case name>/`


NOTE: The input files for the example `electromagnet` in the `thermoelectric` toolbox are in
link:https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/tree/master/examples/modules/thermoelectric/examples/electromagnet[examples/modules/thermoelectric/examples/electromagnet/]


=== Documenting numerical results

Once the test case description and implementation are done, there remains to document the numerical results obtained with {feelpp}.
This step may require

* [x] generating images (`.png` format) using _e.g._ Paraview to show the mesh and fields
* [x] generating {vtkjs} files to have 3D interactive models embedded in the browser to show the mesh and fields
* [x] generating {plotly} interactive graphics embedded in the browser to show 2D data, convergence plots, ...

The generation of {vtkjs} files is now **preferred** as it permits interaction.
Have a look at the xref:examples:csm:README.adoc[examples in computational solid mechanics] providing both images and {vtkjs} files.

NOTE: The image files for the example `electromagnet` in the `thermoelectric` toolbox are in
link:https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/tree/master/examples/modules/thermoelectric/assets/images/electromagnet[examples/modules/thermoelectric/assets/images/electromagnet/]

NOTE: Read about xref:vtkjs.adoc[how to create and use {vtkjs} files] and about xref:contribute:girder:README.adoc[contributing data using girder].

=== Submission

Once you have started working and committing to Github, propose a link:https://github.com/feelpp/toolbox/pulls[pull request (PR)] for merging into the master branch.
