= QuarterTurn

In this example, we will estimate the rise in temperature due to Joules losses in a stranded conductor. An electrical potential stem:[V_0] is applied to the entry/exit of the conductor which is also cooled by a force flow. +
The geometry of the conductor is choosen as to have an analytical expression for the temperature.

== Geometry

The conductor consists in a rectangular cross section torus which is somehow "cut" to allow for applying electrical potential. The conductor is cooled with a force flow along its cylindrical faces.+
In 2D, the geometry is as follow:

In 3D, this is the same geometry, but extruded along the z axis.

=== Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions for the electrical probleme are introduced as simple Dirichlet boundary conditions for the electric potential on the entry/exit of the conductor. For the remaining faces, as no current is flowing througth these faces, we add Homogeneous Neumann conditions.

We will check if the approximations converge at the appropriate rate:

- k+1 for the stem:[L_2] norm for stem:[V] and stem:[T]
- k for the stem:[H_1] norm for stem:[V] and stem:[T]
- k for the stem:[L_2] norm for stem:[\mathbf{E}] and stem:[\mathbf{j}]
- k-1 for the stem:[H_1] norm for stem:[\mathbf{E}] and stem:[\mathbf{j}]
