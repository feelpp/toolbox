= Description of the benchmark

In this example, we will estimate the rise in temperature due to Joules losses in a stranded conductor. An electrical potential $V_D$ is applied to the entry/exit of the conductor which is also cooled by a force flow.
The geometry of the conductor is choosen as to have an analytical expression for the temperature.
