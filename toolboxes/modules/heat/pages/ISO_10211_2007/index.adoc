:description: We simulate a 3D and 2D thermal bridge in a building following the ISO 10211:2007 standard.

== Context

ISO 10211:2007 sets out the specifications for a three-dimensional and a two-dimensional geometrical model of a thermal bridge for the numerical calculation of:

 . heat flows, in order to assess the overall heat loss from a building or part of it;
 . minimum surface temperatures, in order to assess the risk of surface condensation.

These specifications include the geometrical boundaries and subdivisions of the model, the thermal boundary conditions, and the thermal values and relationships  to be used.

ISO 10211:2007 is based upon the following assumptions:

 . all physical properties are independent of temperature;
 . there are no heat sources within the building element.

ISO 10211:2007 can also be used for the derivation of linear and point thermal  transmittances and of surface temperature factors.

== Parameters

The parameters for this benchmark case are given by:

[source,json]
----
{
  "Parameters": {
    "h_top": "1.0/0.06",
    "h_bottom": "1.0/0.11",
    "T0_top": 0,
    "T0_bottom": 20
  }
}
----

These parameters define the top and bottom heat transfer coefficients (`h_top` and `h_bottom`) and the exterior temperatures (`T0_top` and `T0_bottom`).

== Geometry and Mesh

This case uses the following mesh configuration:

.2D mesh (similar in 3D)
[source,json]
----
{
  "Meshes": {
    "heat": {
      "Import": {
        "filename": "$cfgdir/case2.geo",
        "hsize": 0.001
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The geometry is defined in the `case2.geo` file, with a mesh size of 0.001.

== Materials

The materials used in the model include concrete, wood, insulation, and aluminum. The specific parameters are:

[source,json]
----
{
  "Materials": {
    // material data here
  }
}
----

Each material has specific properties including thermal conductivity (`k`), specific heat capacity (`Cp`), and density (`rho`).

== Mathematical Formulation

This simulation solves the steady state heat equation which can be represented by the partial differential equation (PDE):

[latexmath]
++++
\nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) = 0
++++

where:

* [latexmath]_T_ is the temperature,
* [latexmath]_k_ is the thermal conductivity.

== Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions define the state of heat at the boundaries of the geometry.

[source,json]
----
{
  "BoundaryConditions": {
    // boundary condition data here
  }
}
----

The boundary conditions are given by a convective heat flux on the top and bottom of the model. The associated mathematical expressions are:

For the top::
[latexmath]
++++
-h_{\text{top}} \cdot (T - T0_{\text{top}}) = q_n
++++

For the bottom::
[latexmath]
++++
-h_{\text{bottom}} \cdot (T - T0_{\text{bottom}}) = q_n
++++

where:

* [latexmath]_h_ is the heat transfer coefficient,
* [latexmath]_T_ is the temperature,
* [latexmath]_T0_ is the exterior temperature,
* [latexmath]_q_n_ is the heat flux normal to the boundary.

== Post-processing

The post-processing step includes the extraction and analysis of data:

[source,json]
----
{
  "PostProcess": {
    // post-processing data here
  }
}
----

In the post-processing stage, several quantities are computed, including temperature fields, normal heat flux, and the heat flux at specific points.
