The portal is split into several services:

* *Marketplace*, where you can add and/or purchase applications
* *Data Catalogue*, where you can add and/or retrieve data
* *Experiments*, where the app is setup and the simulation is launched
* *Visualization*, to access a Remote desktop to pre and/or post-processes your simulations

[NOTE]
====
For smooth operations of {uri-msoportal-www}, the following ports have to *open*:

* `3000`: *IDM*, the service responsible for authentification
* `5000`: *MarkePlace*
* `8000`: *Data Catalogue*

To check, you can use `nmap -p <port> portal.mso4sc.eu`.

You may need to contact your system admin to check and eventually open these ports.
