:page-description: We simulate the TEAM Workshop 13 Benchmark to compare the saddle point formulation and the regularized one.

The TEAM Workshop 13 link:http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/eb010097[benchmark]  aims to compare various formulations and implementations to solve the non linear magnetostatic problem. We reproduce that benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of our implementation.

== Description

=== Geometry

The geometry consists on an exiting coil set between two steel channels which are not aligned together and a steel plate inserted inside the channels.

=== Magnetic permeability

We only process non linear problems.

To discriminate if the non linear law has an impact on the convergence, we run that benchmark with three stem:[B-H] curves.

- the one given by the Team Workshop 13 Benchmark,
- the one given in link:../Torus/readme.adoc[GetDP],
- a third one that is close to the two others, but with intermediate difficulty. We call it *intermediate*.

==== Interpolation

As long as we only process isotropic concretes, the non linear relations stem:[\mathbf{B} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbf{H})] reads stem:[B = \mu(H) H ].
It is that curve we have to interpolate.
We propose piecewise linear interpolation and akima's interpolation thanks to link:http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/[GSL].

The provided data are the relation of the magnetic induction amplitude stem:[B] against the magnetic field magnitude stem:[H].

We also tried the interpolation of stem:[\mu(H) H] and stem:[\mu(H)] directly. (idem for stem:[\nu]).

image:Tws/NL_law.png[alt="Non Linear relation", caption="Figure 2: B-H relation for different concrete"]

We can observe the relation given in GetDP is the smoothest one.
For the stem:[\Sigma-\Phi] case, we only have one twist in the whole curve and the Team Workshop one provide two twists.

We use extrapolation to extend the magnetic permeability when stem:[\mathbf{H}] goes to infinity.

== Inputs

The source term - stem:[\mathbf{J}] - is generated solving a Laplacian in each half coils.
We present here a top view of an half of the coil.

The gradient of the solution of each problems is multiplied with the number of Amp√®re Turns we want.

[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
    -\Delta u &= 0\\
    \left.  u\right|_{\Gamma+} &= 1\\
    \left.  u\right|_{\Gamma-} &= 0\\
    \mathbf{J} &= At \frac{\nabla u}{\|\nabla u \|}
\end{aligned}
++++

== Outputs

We will compare the various fluxes the Team Workshop 13 Benchmark present and check the convergence in respect with various parameters:

- the formulation: saddle or stabilized,
- the current density
- the non linear formulation
- the stem:[\mu] discretization (stem:[P_1], stem:[P_2]),
- the non linear relation.

== Behavior

Here are the meshes and spaces specifications

|  | Number of elements | Number of Dof stem:[\mathbb{A}] | Number of Dof stem:[p] | Total

|===


Every simulation has run over 48 processors on **irma-atlas**.

=== GetDP non linear curve

We begin with the smoothiest stem:[B-H] relation.
At very low current density, both formulations (saddle, regularized), both algorithms (Picard, Polarization) with the two kinds of stem:[\mu] discretizaion converge.

Here we show that the polarization method is not robust against high density current.

At first, we can observe
- the Polarization method does not handle the hight current density,
- the regularized formulation is always faster,
- the saddle point formulation is always more accurate,
- the stem:[\mu] space discretization has a little impact in the convergence.

=== TEAM Workshop 13 non linear curve

We have observed with the getDP relation the polarization method is not robust.
We have observed with the stem:[\Sigma-\Phi] relation the regularity of the relation can be a bottleneck.

Here, we show the team Workshop 13 stem:[B-H] relation provide us - at best - non fully convergent simulations and only saddle-point formulation with picard algorithm can be run.

== Remarks

**Polarization or Picard ? **

At first, we can be dispointed with the very small advantage the Polarization method provide considering the computing time.
It has to be higlighted the `update()` method - for the non linear right hand side or the magnetic permeability - has an effect on the magnetic concrete.
As long as the ratio of magnetic concrete volume in the whole volume of computation is always little, we are not surprised to face a very little improvement in the method.
Actually, rebuilding the preconditioner does seem to be that time consuming.

**Saddle or Regularizd ? **

Considering our results, we recommend the following strategy:
- run the regularized formulation until a stationnary point is found,
- use the current stem:[\mathbb{A}] as an initial guess for the saddle point method.

**stem:[\mu] discretization**

Our calculus has not shown a sufficient difference to definitely chose.

== Propositions

Here the ideas we do not have time to test.

=== Polarization

The polarization generate a right hand side that can present huge variations - see the stem:[B-H] curve for stem:[B \approx 1.8] for example.
In the present geometry, the maximum of stem:[B] is achieved at the boundary of the ferromagnetic concrete.
That is the non linear right hand side is discontinuous along the boundary of the ferromagnetic concrete, with a huge variation.
We recommend to test the stem:[L_2] projection of the non linear right hand side in the whole domain to smooth it, with a smoothing parameter decreasing with the iterations to decrease the effect of this projection.

=== Continuity

Considering the convergence is mainly linked to the current density, a contiuation algorithm has to be testesd.

=== Mixing Polarization and Picard.

The Polarization method reads:
[stem]
++++
B = \mu_{opt} H + I
++++
where the picard method reads:
[stem]
++++
B = \mu_0 \mu_r H
++++
The idea we propose is to write:
[stem]
++++
\begin{aligned}
B^{(n)} &= \mu_{opt} H ^{(n)} + I^{(n)} \\
        &= \mu_0 \mu_r^{(n)} H^{(n)}
\end{aligned}
++++
That is
[stem]
++++
\mu_r^{(n)} = \frac{\mu_{opt}}{\mu_0} + \frac{1}{\mu_0 H^{(n)}} I^{(n)}
++++

That is we can transfert the non linearity from the right hand side to the matrix whenever we have to.
