Welcome to the Thermo-Electric toolbox

The Thermoelectric toolbox combines  the Electric Currents toolbox with the Heat Transfer toolbox to model resistive heating and heating due to dielectric losses.
The multiphysics couplings add the electromagnetic power dissipation as a heat source, and the electromagnetic material properties can depend on the temperature.
