= What is a Toolbox

{feelpp} comes with toolboxes. What are they ?

.Definition: A {feelpp} Toolbox
****
For a given set of partial differential equations for a given physics (_e.g._ xref:toolboxes:cfd:index.adoc[computational fluid dynamics]) or set of physics (_e.g._ xref:toolboxes:fsi:index.adoc[fluid structure interaction]), a {feelpp} toolbox provides:

* the configuration the set of equations through one or several (`.json`) files and (`.cfg`) files
* one or more solution strategies to solve the set of equations
****

Using the xref:modeling-analysis-using-json-files.adoc[JSON] and xref:parametrized-simulation-using-cfg-files.adoc[CFG], it is possible
to configure and run models by defining the relevant physical quantitiesâ€”such as material properties, loads, constraints, sources, and fluxes.
The data analysis can be also described in these files.

In order to run a simulation with a toolbox, an exectuable is required. It is generally associated to one or several CFG files.
The toolbox setup is applied through several options which are prefixed by a name associated to the toolbox.
In the following table, we have listed for each toolbox the name of executable and the prefix used in CFG files :

== Run an application

In this section, we describe the several possibilities to perform a simulation using a toolbox executable and a CFG file.
In the following examples, we have used the executable of fluid mechanics toolbox called `feelpp_toolbox_fluid`.

From an executable, a cfg file must be given in the command line thanks to the `config-file` option :
[source,shell]
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --config-file myfile.cfg
----

Another way is to use the `case` option, where case represents a folder containing a cfg, json files and eventually a geometry or mesh file.
[source,shell]
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case mydir
----

If the folder contains only one cfg, the programme use this one. Else it's possible to specify the cfg file to choose by adding `case.config-file` option 

[source,shell]
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case mydir --case.config-file myfile.cfg
----

The `case` option can also define a folder which represents a remote data in a github repository.
[source,shell]
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case "github:{path:toolboxes/fluid/TurekHron}" --case.config-file cfd2.cfg
----

The remote data from github can be configured by several parameters :

|===
| Option | Default value | Description

| `owner` | feelpp | the github organization
| `repo` | feelpp | the github repository in organization
| `branch` | <default in github> | the branch in the git repository
| `path` |  <root of repository> | the path in the git repository
| `token` | <no default value> | an authentication token
|===

[source,shell]
----
feelpp_toolbox_fluid --case "github:{owner:feelpp,repo:feelpp,branch:develop,path:toolboxes/fluid/TurekHron,token:xxxxx}" --case.config-file cfd2.cfg
----
