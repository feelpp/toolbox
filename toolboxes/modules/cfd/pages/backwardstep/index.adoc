We describe the benchmark proposed in <<Armaly>>,<<Erturk>> and <<Stefano>>

== Description

Problem summary::
Let us consider the backward-facing step benchmark illustrated in Figure <<fig:step,1>>, which is an example of an inflow/outflow problem. The inflow is at stem:[x=-1] and the outflow is at stem:[x=5] for stem:[Re=10] and stem:[Re=100], at stem:[x=10] for stem:[Re=200] and at stem:[x=20] for stem:[Re=400].

.2D Geometry
image::backwardstep/geometry.svg[]

The mathematical model reads as follows:

[stem]
++++
 -\nu\Delta\mathbf{u} +\rho (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u} +\nabla p   =  \mathbf{0},  \mbox{ in } \Omega  \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}  =  0, \mbox{ in } \Omega
++++
We choose an implicit treatment of the convective term and a non symmetric formulation of the deformation tensor. We will deal with the nonlinear system arising from the discrete Navier-Stokes equations by using Picard iterations.

=== Boundary conditions

- Boundary conditions formulation

* a no-flow condition is imposed on the wall

* a Newmann condition is applied at the outflow boundary

* A Poiseuille flow profile is imposed on the inflow boundary. The 2D and 3D Poiseuille profiles are defined respectively as follow:
[stem]
++++
u_x = 6y(1-y)\\
u_y=0
++++
and
[stem]
++++
u_x=24y(1-y)z(1-z)\\
u_y=0\\
u_z=0
++++


=== Initial conditions

- Initial condition: The initial iterate stem:[(\mathbf{u}_0, p_0)] is obtained by solving the corresponding discrete Stokes problem.

Mesh generation:: Gmsh
Partitioner:: Metis
PostProcessing:: Paraview
Preconditioner:: PCD (GAMG for $$A_p$$ and $$M_p$$ sub-problems, as for $$F_u$$ we coupled Fieldsplit with block Jacobi. For each components of $$F_u$$ we applied a GAMG preconditioner for $$Re=10, 100$$ and  $$Re=200$$. As for $$Re=400$$ we used the DD method GASM with LU in the subdomains for the components of $$F_u$$ sub-matrix. (We used a relative tolerance of $$10^{-6}$$ for each sub-problem).
Solver:: GCR 

The stopping criterion of the nonlinear iteration is when the vector Euclidean norm of the nonlinear residual reaches  a relative error of $$10^{-6}$$, that is
[stem]
++++
\| \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{f} - \left( F_\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{u}^{m})\mathbf{u}^{(m)} + B^Tp^{(m)}\right)\\ \mathbf{g} - B\mathbf{u}^{(m)}\end{pmatrix} \|  \leq 10^{-6} \| \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{f}\\ \mathbf{g}\end{pmatrix}\|
++++
As for the starting vector for the linearized iteration it is set to zero and the stopping criterion is
[stem]
++++
\|\mathbf{r}^{(k)}\| \leq 10^{-6}\|S^{(m)}\| ,
++++
where stem:[\mathbf{r}^{(k)}] is the residual of the linear system and stem:[S^{(m)}] is the left-hand side residual associated with the final nonlinear system.
