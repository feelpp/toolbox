Welcome to the Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) toolbox.
This module explains how to use the Laminar Flow interface to model and simulate fluid mechanics for laminar, incompressible fluids.

NOTE: The engineering community often uses the term CFD, computational fluid dynamics, to refer to the numerical simulation of fluids.

== Features

* 2D and 3D
* Stokes flows
* Laminar Incompressible flows
* Steady and unsteady simulations
* BDF time schemes up to order 4
* Moving domain support using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation
* Support high order geometry including in context of moving domain
* Stabilization pressure and advection dominated using Galerking Least Square
* Boundary conbditions : no-slip, slip(symmetry), inflow(not necessarily aligned with an axis), pressure, outflow
